### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ name's Patrick, nice to meet ya. 

#### ðŸ”­  I'm currently working as a Front End Engineer, with React (with Hooks!), Redux, TypeScript, JavaScript(ES6+), Webpack, Protobufs (Protocol Buffers), and Firebase. I also am in charge of my current role's CI/CD pipelines, with React Testing Library, Cypress, and GitHub Actions.

#### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Go, Docker, and various tools related to GCP. I'm highly interested in going towards a "fullstack" route.

#### âš¡ Fun fact: I once escaped from a locked train in Amsterdam.
